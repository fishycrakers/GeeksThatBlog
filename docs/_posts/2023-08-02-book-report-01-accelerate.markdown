## The Book
[Accelerate: The Science Behind Devops: Building and Scaling High Performing Technology Organizations](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40313863-accelerate) (Goodreads.com)

## Summary of Contents
Dr. Nicole Forsgren, Jez Humble and Gene Kim conduct 4 years of research into what differentiates a high-performing
development team, from a low-performing one. They provide the results of their research, as well as the figures that have driven
these results.

They note that [DevOps Research and Assesment (DORA)](https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/devops-sre/the-2019-accelerate-state-of-devops-elite-performance-productivity-and-scaling) metrics are clear indicators
of what define a high-performing team. These metrics are as follows:

- Lead Time - _The amount of time it takes a commit to get into production._
- Deployment Frequency - _How often an organization successfully releases to production._
- Change Failure Percentage - _The percentage of deployments causing a failure in production._
- Mean Time to Restore - _How long it takes an organization to recover from a failure in production._
